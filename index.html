                                            When I look back on our wedding day I tend to think of all the fun I had with our photographers,
                                             A.B Cinema Granted it, it was the most special day of both me and my husband’s lives but I really appreciated the thought A.B Cinema put behind capturing all of those intimate moments on film. 
                                             They both had a vision, and executed it phenomenally.  A.B Cinema are always game for any idea you have and have such a creative vision that is transparent in their photography. 
                                            I always have friends, family members and co-workers always telling me just how outrageously beautiful our photos are, and that they should be in a magazine.
                                            I am so glad they were there behind the lenses on our wedding day,
                                             they exceeded every expectation and then some and now we have these INCREDIBLE memories they have captured to look back on and remember.

                                             <br>We feel so fortunate to have had A.B Cinema take our family portraits more than once! 
                                             Most recently, they took pictures of our new baby girl.
                                              They brought everything needed for the photo shoot right to the comfort of our home which was such a blessing when you have a new baby!
                                               They truly understood the time and patience that it takes to get that perfect shot of a newborn baby.
                                              We will forever cherish the beautiful pictures that A.B Cinema have taken for us!

                                              <br>A.B Cinema is a beautiful soul with a beautiful smile, which of course allows them capture the most beautiful things through the lens of their camera. 
                                              I have to say one of the best parts of our wedding was not only the images she captured for us, but the fun we had doing it. 
                                              We not only got amazingly stunning pictures and video, they also caught the absolute essence of our little family.
                                               I couldn't be more thankful for the memories she created and photographed. 
                                               they are talent, I would recommend to anyone anywhere for any occasion. 
                                              Thank you A.B Cinema for making our day so magical!! We love you!!!!!!

                                        <br><br>If you are thinking about choosing A.B Cinema for your event, do it!
                                     A.B Cinema did an amazing job capturing our special day. Not only were the pictures beautiful, but they were fun as well. 
                                     They really brought out our personalities and made sure that the images/videos reflected our style. I still smile every time I look at them.
